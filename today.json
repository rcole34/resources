Certainly, there was Africa-inspired jewelry available, but much of it lacked the bohemian design aesthetic that fit my taste and style as an African American literature professor. I wanted pieces that could say a lot without doing a lot. My jewelry needed to standout and be distinctive while remaining wearable. I wanted a jewelry wardrobe that reflected my tastes, my passions, my culture, my research interests. And so I began to make my own, sourcing authentic, African diasporic materials, curating and refining my work as my knowledge and skill developed. Eventually, I decided to share my work and Aisha Likes It came into existence.\n\nAisha Likes it is home to African-inspired jewelry curated towards a bohemian aesthetic created with both ethically sourced materials from throughout the African diaspora and traditional semi-precious stones. Each piece is designed to make a statement at a fair price. ",
