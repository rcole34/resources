Echoing the requests of Louisville community organizers, the following demands must be met to ensure that the officers responsible for Breonna's death are held accountable for their brash, reprehensible actions:</p>  <ol><li>Your office and the Louisville City Council must address the use of force by the Louisville Metro Police</li> <li>The officers that killed Breonna (Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Brett Hankison, and Detective Myles Cosgrove) must be fired, and have their pensions revoked</li> <li>Ensure that all necessary information is provided to a local, independent civilian community police accountability council</li> <li>Create policy for a transparent investigation process due to law enforcement misconduct</li> <li>Appoint a special prosecutor to bring forward charges against the officers and oversee all parts of this case</li></ol> <p>It is imperative that you condemn the actions of these officers. Raids cannot be performed with a shoot first, ask questions later mentality. Too many lives have been lost this way, and too often \"danger\" is determined by deeply entrenched racial biases, not actual threat level.</p> <p>It is a tragedy that Breonna Taylor is not alive today. Police must be held to a higher standard than this. I trust that your office and the involved parties will do the right thing.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>[Your name] from [Your location]</p>",

A crime for which he has always maintained his innocence.</p>  <p>Jones, a black 19 year old man, was arrested in 1999 for shooting white insurance executive Paul Scott Howell in Edmond, Oklahoma. At the time of his arrest, Julius was a successful athlete and honor student on scholarship at the University of Oklahoma.</p>  <p>Recently, new evidence of racial bias in the Jones&rsquo; case has been uncovered by the ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense.&rdquo;</p>  <p>One day after the documentary finale aired (7-25-18), the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals released a document indicating they could take a look at the Jones&rsquo; case.</p>  <p>There are many factors that were overlooked and never presented during the Julius Jones trial.<br> 1. Jones&rsquo; attorney during the trial was inexperienced by his own admission and this was his first death penalty case.<br> 2. Several key pieces of evidence were never presented to the jury.<br> 3. Tunnel vision set in and the police and prosecutor ignored evidence pointing to others as the shooter.<br> 4. The court ignored an alleged racial statement made by one of the jurors<br> 5. The jury judged Jones based on his race.<br> After viewing the recent ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense,&rdquo; I am even more convinced than ever of Julius&rsquo; innocence and that he should be given a new trial. I also ask that District Attorney David Prater release Julius Jones&rsquo; case files to his attorneys in order to promote public trust in both the criminal justice system and in Julius Jones&rsquo;s case.</p>  <p>We all have all heard the phrase &lsquo;beyond a shadow of doubt.&rsquo; To me, there is more than a shadow of doubt in this case.</p>  <p>Please, I ask that you do whatever is within your power to support Julius Jones&rsquo; Clemency Petition and see that this injustice &ndash; the wrongful conviction of Julius Jones &ndash; is overturned.</p>  <p>Thank you,<br> [Your Name]<br> [Your location]</p>",
