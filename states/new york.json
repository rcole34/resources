It was a while before I understood the importance of knowing my roots and that meant stripping myself of everything that was not originally me.   Eventually, as the years went by ,my interest for creating homemade products was that of something more than a hobby and quickly became my passion. I created this brand because I wanted to share the same products that I use to take care of my hair with you. They have helped my hair in more than one way and I look forward to watching it helps you.\n\nAll products have been tested out and tried on many ethnic hair types and the outcome regardless of differences have always remain positive.",
