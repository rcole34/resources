A crime for which he has always maintained his innocence.</p>  <p>Jones, a black 19 year old man, was arrested in 1999 for shooting white insurance executive Paul Scott Howell in Edmond, Oklahoma. At the time of his arrest, Julius was a successful athlete and honor student on scholarship at the University of Oklahoma.</p>  <p>Recently, new evidence of racial bias in the Jones&rsquo; case has been uncovered by the ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense.&rdquo;</p>  <p>One day after the documentary finale aired (7-25-18), the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals released a document indicating they could take a look at the Jones&rsquo; case.</p>  <p>There are many factors that were overlooked and never presented during the Julius Jones trial.<br> 1. Jones&rsquo; attorney during the trial was inexperienced by his own admission and this was his first death penalty case.<br> 2. Several key pieces of evidence were never presented to the jury.<br> 3. Tunnel vision set in and the police and prosecutor ignored evidence pointing to others as the shooter.<br> 4. The court ignored an alleged racial statement made by one of the jurors<br> 5. The jury judged Jones based on his race.<br> After viewing the recent ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense,&rdquo; I am even more convinced than ever of Julius&rsquo; innocence and that he should be given a new trial. I also ask that District Attorney David Prater release Julius Jones&rsquo; case files to his attorneys in order to promote public trust in both the criminal justice system and in Julius Jones&rsquo;s case.</p>  <p>We all have all heard the phrase &lsquo;beyond a shadow of doubt.&rsquo; To me, there is more than a shadow of doubt in this case.</p>  <p>Please, I ask that you do whatever is within your power to support Julius Jones&rsquo; Clemency Petition and see that this injustice &ndash; the wrongful conviction of Julius Jones &ndash; is overturned.</p>  <p>Thank you,<br> [Your Name]<br> [Your location]</p>",

        "messageBody": "<p>Hi, my name is [Your name]</p>  <p>I am contacting you regarding the arrest of local leader and activist Tianna Arata. Tianna is an extremely brave young person who has put her body on the line for her community, peacefully protesting throughout the past weeks against systemic racism and white supremacy. Tianna has a long history of being an activist and has always advocated for those in marginalized communities in every aspect of her life.</p>  <p>The SLO protests have been extremely peaceful, and the night of her arrest was no different. On July 21, after the protest was winding down, Tianna was forcefully and violently arrested by six police officers. Witnesses say she was with friends, putting their stuff back into their cars. She was charged with five counts, including two felonies, one of which was inciting a riot. All reporting on this night of protests say it was extremely peaceful.</p>  <p>It is obvious that the city of SLO is violently targeting this leader of the local Black Lives Matter movement in an attempt to quell resistance to racism and oppression. She has never advocated for any sort of violence in her protests, for this reason exactly. Leaders, especially young Black women, are often targeted simply for standing up for their lives and rights, and trying to better their communities. It is abhorrent that SLO is participating in this display of state violence and white supremacy. Because of this, I demand that all charges be dropped against Tianna and she be returned to her family immediately.</p>  <p>Tianna is innocent. I stand with her and reaffirm that her life and freedom matters, as well as the lives of all Black SLO residents. Correct your mistakes. Listen to your people. Do better.</p>  <p>As of Monday, August 10th, the charges against Tianna have been increased to four felony counts of false imprisonment, one count of felony conspiracy, and three misdemeanors. Tianna faces up to FIFTEEN years in prison because of these ludicrous charges. Facing these charges and possibly being convicted is leading, and will lead to, devastating repercussions for Tianna. Already, she is dealing with extreme anxiety, harassment, feeling unsafe in her own home and community, and more. Her future will be destroyed. Her dreams will be squashed. She is a leader, a student, an extremely hard worker, a beacon of joy and light, an athlete, a creative, a daughter, and most of all a person. Again, these charges will destroy Tianna's life. Drop them immediately.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>[Your name]</p>",

Echoing the requests of Louisville community organizers, the following demands must be met to ensure that the officers responsible for Breonna's death are held accountable for their brash, reprehensible actions:</p>  <ol><li>Your office and the Louisville City Council must address the use of force by the Louisville Metro Police</li> <li>The officers that killed Breonna (Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, Detective Brett Hankison, and Detective Myles Cosgrove) must be fired, and have their pensions revoked</li> <li>Ensure that all necessary information is provided to a local, independent civilian community police accountability council</li> <li>Create policy for a transparent investigation process due to law enforcement misconduct</li> <li>Appoint a special prosecutor to bring forward charges against the officers and oversee all parts of this case</li></ol> <p>It is imperative that you condemn the actions of these officers. Raids cannot be performed with a shoot first, ask questions later mentality. Too many lives have been lost this way, and too often \"danger\" is determined by deeply entrenched racial biases, not actual threat level.</p> <p>It is a tragedy that Breonna Taylor is not alive today. Police must be held to a higher standard than this. I trust that your office and the involved parties will do the right thing.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>[Your name] from [Your location]</p>",
