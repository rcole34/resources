A crime for which he has always maintained his innocence.</p>  <p>Jones, a black 19 year old man, was arrested in 1999 for shooting white insurance executive Paul Scott Howell in Edmond, Oklahoma. At the time of his arrest, Julius was a successful athlete and honor student on scholarship at the University of Oklahoma.</p>  <p>Recently, new evidence of racial bias in the Jones&rsquo; case has been uncovered by the ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense.&rdquo;</p>  <p>One day after the documentary finale aired (7-25-18), the Oklahoma Criminal Court of Appeals released a document indicating they could take a look at the Jones&rsquo; case.</p>  <p>There are many factors that were overlooked and never presented during the Julius Jones trial.<br> 1. Jones&rsquo; attorney during the trial was inexperienced by his own admission and this was his first death penalty case.<br> 2. Several key pieces of evidence were never presented to the jury.<br> 3. Tunnel vision set in and the police and prosecutor ignored evidence pointing to others as the shooter.<br> 4. The court ignored an alleged racial statement made by one of the jurors<br> 5. The jury judged Jones based on his race.<br> After viewing the recent ABC documentary, &ldquo;The Last Defense,&rdquo; I am even more convinced than ever of Julius&rsquo; innocence and that he should be given a new trial. I also ask that District Attorney David Prater release Julius Jones&rsquo; case files to his attorneys in order to promote public trust in both the criminal justice system and in Julius Jones&rsquo;s case.</p>  <p>We all have all heard the phrase &lsquo;beyond a shadow of doubt.&rsquo; To me, there is more than a shadow of doubt in this case.</p>  <p>Please, I ask that you do whatever is within your power to support Julius Jones&rsquo; Clemency Petition and see that this injustice &ndash; the wrongful conviction of Julius Jones &ndash; is overturned.</p>  <p>Thank you,<br> [Your Name]<br> [Your location]</p>",
